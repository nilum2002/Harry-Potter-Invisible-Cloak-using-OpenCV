This is what I have done here...!

First I take a the background without anybody. Then I select the color that I want to disappear form the our frame.
After hiding the cloak the algorithm show the output.

Here I use the opposite of the green screen. In green screening what we do is remove background. but here I remove the foreground frame.

The algorithm follows like this.
        01. Capture and store the background.
        02. Detect the colored cloak by clicking.
        03. Segment out the selected colored cloth by generating a mask
        04. Generate the final augmented output to create a magical effect.


Thank You and Have Fun ... !
